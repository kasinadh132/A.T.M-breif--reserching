Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

What Is an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)?
An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs.


ATMs are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, bill payments, and transfers between accounts. Fees are commonly charged for cash withdrawals by the bank where the account is located, by the operator of the ATM, or by both. Some or all of these fees can be avoided by using an ATM operated directly by the bank that holds the account.


ATMs are known in different parts of the world as automated bank machines (ABM) or cash machines.


Understanding Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)
The first ATM appeared at a branch of Barclay's Bank in London in 1967,though there are reports of a cash dispenser in use in Japan in the mid-1960s.
The interbank communications networks that allowed a consumer to use one bank's card at another bank's ATM came later, in the 1970s.


Within a few years, ATMs had spread around the globe, securing a presence in every major country. They now can be found even in tiny island nations such as Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia.
Types of ATMs
There are two primary types of ATMs. Basic units only allow customers to withdraw cash and receive updated account balances. The more complex machines accept deposits, facilitate line-of-credit payments and transfers, and access account information.

To access the advanced features of the complex units, a user often must be an account holder at the bank that operates the machine.

Analysts anticipate ATMs will become even more popular and forecast an increase in the number of ATM withdrawals. ATMs of the future are likely to be full-service terminals instead of or in addition to traditional bank tellers.

ATM Design Elements
Although the design of each ATM is different, they all contain the same basic parts:

Card reader: This part reads the chip on the front of the card or the magnetic stripe on the back of the card.
Keypad: The keypad is used by the customer to input information, including personal identification number (PIN), the type of transaction required, and the amount of the transaction.
Cash dispenser: Bills are dispensed through a slot in the machine, which is connected to a safe at the bottom of the machine.
Printer: If required, consumers can request receipts that are printed here. The receipt records the type of transaction, the amount, and the account balance.
Screen: The ATM issues prompts that guide the consumer through the process of executing the transaction. Information is also transmitted on the screen, such as account information and balances.
Full-service machines now often have slots for depositing paper checks or cash.
